# jscripts

Scripts I use to add additional functions on specific websites for personal purposes.

## Setup

1/ Install extension [Script executer](https://github.com/aneelkkhatri/script-executor) on Chrom browser.
The extension is very simple and works very well, I really like it so that I made a copy of it, and put it on the folder `script-executor`, just in case it disappears someday.

2/ Open the the extension and load necessary scripts, then Save.

3/ Done.
